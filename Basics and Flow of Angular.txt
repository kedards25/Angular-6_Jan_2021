Any front end technology allows us to create SPA(Single Page Application)

index.html
	content within web page keeps updating depending upon user 	request
	Components helps to implement SPA

index.html has <app-root></app-root> tag in which appComponent is loaded
index.html
	<app-root></app-root>


Each component in Angular has 3 main files
	<comp-name>.component.ts	=>logic and data
	<comp-name>.component.css	=>stylesheet
	<comp-name>.component.html	=>template file

app-component has
	app.module.ts	=>config->will contain the info about 					everything we require for the whole 					application and names of components to be 				registered(injected) with app component	
	app.component.ts=>logic of app component	
	app.component.css
	app.component.html=>will hold reference to all other 				components as tags
